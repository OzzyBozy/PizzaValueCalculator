Welcome! Have you ever wondered if you're getting your money's worth from your pizza while choosing between different sizes? This app offers an intuitive and quick way to compare different pizza sizes and prices to calculate which option gives you the most value.

## Contents
* [`AndroidApp`](AndroidApp) contains all the necessary project files for the Android application
* [`Images`](Images) includes screenshots and other media of the app
* [`LICENSE`](LICENSE.txt) entails the properties of this projects license
* [`Releases`](https://github.com/OzzyBozy/PizzaValueCalculator/releases) contains the files for downloading the app

**Pizza Value Calculator** allows users to input the following for two pizzas:

- Pizza sizes (in diameter or radius)
- Pizza prices
- (Optionally) Fractional sizes for more advanced comparisons

The app then calculates and compares price-per-area values for each pizza, showing you exactly which one delivers more pizza per money with percentages. It also visually scales the pizzas to show their size difference.

### Example:

<table>
<tr>
<td width="25%">Empty UI</td>
<td width="25%">UI with 3 inputs, suggesting the 4th</td>
<td width="25%">UI with complete data, comparing the value</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
