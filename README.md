**Pizza Value Calculator** allows users to input the following for two pizzas:

- Pizza sizes (in diameter or radius)
- Pizza prices
- (Optionally) Fractional sizes for more advanced comparisons

The app then calculates and compares price-per-area values for each pizza, showing you exactly which one delivers more pizza per money with percentages. It also visually scales the pizzas to show their size difference.

#### Example:

<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Empty UI in dark mode</td>
<td>UI with 3 inputs, suggesting the 4th</td>
<td>UI with complete data, comparing the value</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="Images/EmptyUI.png" alt="empty ui"></td>
<td><img src="Images/EstimationExample.png" alt="estimation example"></td>
<td><img src="Images/ValueComparison.png" alt="value comparison"></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
