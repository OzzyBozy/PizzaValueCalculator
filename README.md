**Pizza Value Calculator** allows users to input the following for two pizzas:

- Pizza sizes (in diameter or radius)
- Pizza prices
- (Optionally) Fractional sizes for more advanced comparisons

The app then calculates and compares price-per-area values for each pizza, showing you exactly which one delivers more pizza per money with percentages.
